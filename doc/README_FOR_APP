= This is a demonstration Rails app that shows how the rmb-rails gem works and how an application using the gem can configure itself to 
listening to message brokers and receiving messages.

== Model classes

* Listener
Basic housekeeping class to support Listener daemons.  For each Listener daemon, there is a Listener class to collect parameters and to instantiate a 
ListenerClient when the daemon has to be started or stopped.  This is quite a plain vanilla Rails model.

* Document
This is a simple class to act as a repository for messages delivered.  There is one somewhat subtle method, data_file=, which marshals the message body out
of the temporary file that the daemon put it in, the rest is plain vanilla.

* User
This is another plain vanilla AR model, taken in large part for the Agile Web Development with Rails book.  It is intended that daemons be required to 
login to the app they are sending messages to, but that has not yet been implemented in the daemon.

* PasswordGenerator
This class is a wrapper for the ngrams gem, which generates passwords that look like real words, but they're not.
